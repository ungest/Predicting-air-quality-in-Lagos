## Predicting Air Quality in Lagos: A Time Series Model for PM2.5 Levels

### Overview
This repository hosts a time series forecasting model focused on predicting PM2.5 air quality levels in Lagos, Nigeria. Given the status of Lagos as one of Africa's most populous cities, it confronts substantial environmental challenges, notably in managing air quality. The model here is designed to address these challenges by providing accurate predictions of PM2.5 concentrations.

### Data Source
The model is built using historical air quality data sourced from [Open Africa](https://africaopendata.org/). This rich dataset enables the model to capture the complex patterns of PM2.5 fluctuations over time.

### Model Significance
- **Urban Planning and Policy Making**: The forecasts generated are vital for urban planners and environmental policymakers, offering data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.
- **Public Health Utility**: Health officials can leverage these predictions to understand and mitigate the health risks associated with varying levels of air pollutants.
- **Temporal Analysis of Pollution Trends**: The model aids in dissecting pollution trends over time, enabling a deeper understanding of temporal dynamics.

### Application
- **Proactive Measures**: The insights provided by the model empowerS government and stakeholders to take proactive steps in pollution control.
- **Strategy Development**: It serves as a key tool in developing effective strategies to improve air quality.
- **Enhancing Health and Well-being**: Ultimately, the model contributes to efforts aimed at enhancing the health and well-being of residents in Lagos.
